    <p id="intro">    
        I was raised in Calgary, currently living in Airdrie with my spouse and parakeet Marley. 
        I enjoy traveling, working on my creative outlets on Etsy, and challenging myself to learn new skills. 
        I have been dabbling in code on and off since my teen years and would like to advance my knowledge and turn it into a new career,
         preferably freelance.
